To Whom It May Concern:

After the karbytes micro-directory associated with the @karlinarayberinger GitHub repository named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_49 was officially deemed by its creator to be in its final state (as of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 18_NOVEMBER_2025), it was assumed that karbytes would not be officially updated until some point in time between 12:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 01_JANUARY_2026 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 07_JANUARY_2026. As of 4:20PM Pacific Standard Time on 29_NOVEMBER_2025, the aforementioned (sole) author (of karbytes) decided to end that hiatus period before the end of the year 2025 in order to carry on with normal (full-capacity; no holding back) activity levels pertaining to the upkeep and expansion of karbytes (the web-based empire consisting of publicly-available digital files curated and often originally produced by that author (whose "social-interfacing name" is Kar Beringer (and whose online alias/cyberspace-based brand name is karbytes))).
