<p>In the background of my visual field at all of its &#8220;points&#8221; (and seemingly at all times) I notice what appear to be &#8220;randomly&#8221; distributed &#8220;pixels&#8221; which flash in and out of existence extremely quickly. I also experience what seems to be the auditory equivalent of that in the form of what appears to be a constant, faint, tinnitus-like &#8220;ringing.&#8221; The significance of such commonplace phenomena is that it seems to be some of the most direct empirical evidence I can observe (and remember) of me witnessing apparent &#8220;breaks&#8221; in the continuity of my moment-to-moment conscious awareness. The apparent oscillations of &#8220;sound waves&#8221; which I hear as &#8220;baseline auditory static&#8221; and the apparent oscillations of &#8220;light waves&#8221; which I see as &#8220;baseline visual static&#8221; appear to hint at where wave-like energy patterns are encoded and/or decoded by my nervous system to and from &#8220;condensed&#8221; discrete data (and I hypothesize that what I actually observe as qualia in my subjective first-person &#8220;real-time&#8221; experience is actually a &#8220;lossy&#8221; capture attempt of something which is indefinitely large in terms of dimension number and dimension-scope coordinates).</p>
<p>I am interested in studying how my brain (and/or universe) renders qualia in a manner which suggests that time is flowing in a singular direction at a constant rate. I hypothesize there are ways I can observe my perception of time change, such as varying consciousness frames-per-second values or varying distribution patterns of electricity throughout the computational hardware of my &#8220;brain.&#8221; I hypothesize (and seem to regularly experience) the sense of there being multiple &#8220;processing cores&#8221; substantiating my consciousness stream, because it seems that I can sense epiphanies happening in a time-dependent procedural manner where one of those &#8220;cores&#8221; seems to register its part of the message before some other one of those &#8220;cores&#8221; registers its part of the same message. From my end in a normal state of waking consciousness, those &#8220;cores&#8221; seem to be firing at the same time (and in zero time) such that I do not seem to detect any internal cognitive or perceptual lag. In some altered states of consciousness, I seem to notice the lower-level chain-reaction processes underlying my otherwise (spatially) solid and (temporally) instant mental model of my environment more vividly than when I am in a more normal state of consciousness.</p>
<p>What I intend to be pointed out as most significant in the previous paragraph (and perhaps on this entire web page) is the idea that I do not actually experience &#8220;the now,&#8221; and what I do experience instead of some hypothetical &#8220;now point&#8221; in time is some of my brain&#8217;s processing cores rendering qualia depicting &#8220;the past&#8221; (especially within the scope of milliseconds, seconds, and minutes (but not hours)) and some of those cores rendering qualia about how I imagine the future will be (especially within the scope of milliseconds). Some of those cores which render qualia which I interpret as slightly in the past from now could be rendering qualia which are not the same age but which appear to be phenomenologically identical from my &#8220;end user&#8221; point of view (in normal states of consciousness). In other words, it could be that the closest I physically come to coming into direct contact with the now is observing something slightly in the past at the same time I am witnessing something else which is also slightly in the past but not quite as much (such that I appear to myself to be temporally &#8220;located&#8221; between those two very recent (less than a second ago each) points in my past).</p>
