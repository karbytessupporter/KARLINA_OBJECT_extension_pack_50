In the background of my visual field at all of its "points" (and seemingly at all times) I notice what appear to be "randomly" distributed "pixels" which flash in and out of existence extremely quickly. I also experience what seems to be the auditory equivalent of that in the form of what appears to be a constant, faint, tinnitus-like "ringing." The significance of such commonplace phenomena is that it seems to be some of the most direct empirical evidence I can observe (and remember) of me witnessing apparent "breaks" in the continuity of my moment-to-moment conscious awareness. The apparent oscillations of "sound waves" which I hear as "baseline auditory static" and the apparent oscillations of "light waves" which I see as "baseline visual static" appear to hint at where wave-like energy patterns are encoded and/or decoded by my nervous system to and from "condensed" discrete data (and I hypothesize that what I actually observe as qualia in my subjective first-person "real-time" experience is actually a "lossy" capture attempt of something which is indefinitely large in terms of dimension number and dimension-scope coordinates).

I am interested in studying how my brain (and/or universe) renders qualia in a manner which suggests that time is flowing in a singular direction at a constant rate. I hypothesize there are ways I can observe my perception of time change, such as varying consciousness frames-per-second values or varying distribution patterns of electricity throughout the computational hardware of my "brain." I hypothesize (and seem to regularly experience) the sense of there being multiple "processing cores" substantiating my consciousness stream, because it seems that I can sense epiphanies happening in a time-dependent procedural manner where one of those "cores" seems to register its part of the message before some other one of those "cores" registers its part of the same message. From my end in a normal state of waking consciousness, those "cores" seem to be firing at the same time (and in zero time) such that I do not seem to detect any internal cognitive or perceptual lag. In some altered states of consciousness, I seem to notice the lower-level chain-reaction processes underlying my otherwise (spatially) solid and (temporally) instant mental model of my environment more vividly than when I am in a more normal state of consciousness.

What I intend to be pointed out as most significant in the previous paragraph (and perhaps on this entire web page) is the idea that I do not actually experience "the now," and what I do experience instead of some hypothetical "now point" in time is some of my brain's processing cores rendering qualia depicting "the past" (especially within the scope of milliseconds, seconds, and minutes (but not hours)) and some of those cores rendering qualia about how I imagine the future will be (especially within the scope of milliseconds). Some of those cores which render qualia which I interpret as slightly in the past from now could be rendering qualia which are not the same age but which appear to be phenomenologically identical from my "end user" point of view (in normal states of consciousness). In other words, it could be that the closest I physically come to coming into direct contact with the now is observing something slightly in the past at the same time I am witnessing something else which is also slightly in the past but not quite as much (such that I appear to myself to be temporally "located" between those two very recent (less than a second ago each) points in my past).
